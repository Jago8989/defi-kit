# Getting Started

You can choose to use the TypeScript SDK right from your browser or install it as a node module for development in a local development environment.

## Browser Playground

The easiest way to get started with the SDK is to use the [browser playground](/sdk-playground).
It allows you to interact with the SDK without having to install anything.

Since the playground code is stored in the URL of the page you can save your work as a bookmark and easily share the link to it with others.
With a single click, you can export your work to cloud-based development environments, such as [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

## Local Installation

The SDK is distributed via npm. For adding it to your project, run:

```bash
npm install --save defi-presets
```

To install it using yarn, run:

```bash
yarn add defi-presets
```

## Import Entrypoints

The package is structured into multiple entrypoints, one for each of the supported blockchains and the base entrypoint.

### `defi-presets/eth`

For Ethereum mainnet, import the `defi-presets/eth` entrypoint:

```typescript
import { allow, apply } from "defi-presets/eth"
```

### `defi-presets`

The base entrypoint offers some generic utilities that are not specific to any blockchain.

```typescript
import { encodeBytes32String, decodeBytes32String } from "defi-presets"

// Roles are referenced with bytes32 keys.
// Use these helper functions to derive human-readable role identifiers.
const roleKey = encodeBytes32String("my-role")
```
